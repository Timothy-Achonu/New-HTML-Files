       How is it possible that someone wants something so dearly 
       and it's right in front of him and he won't take it?
       No one is stopping him and if anything the people around 
       him are helping,aiding and pushing him to get his desired 
       goal,but he still won't take it despite he wants it so much.
       Well, if you cannot be the man you want to be is there any
       reason to live a life you won't be proud of?perhaps you 
       should <span class="red">end it all.</span>
